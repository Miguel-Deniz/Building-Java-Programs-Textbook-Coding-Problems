    Mary plays the piano.
    Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.
    Two seats were vacant.
    How was the math test?
    Where do random thoughts come from?
    She did not cheat on the test, for it was not the right thing to do.
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    Please wait outside of the house.
    She always speaks to him in a loud voice.
    A glittering gem is not enough.
